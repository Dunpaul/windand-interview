To debug a nodejs application showing an error the following steps can be used to fix the error being displayed

- Read the error message: Start by carefully reading and understanding the error message. It can provide valuable information about the nature of the problem.

- Check the error stack trace: The error stack trace will point you to the exact location in the code where the error occurred. Look for the topmost entry in the stack trace to identify the source of the error.

- Review the code at the specified location: Go to the file and line number mentioned in the stack trace and carefully review the corresponding code. Look for any syntax errors, missing dependencies, or logical issues that could be causing the error.

- Review relevant dependencies: If the error message mentions a specific dependency, make sure to review its documentation and verify that it is installed correctly and being used properly in your code.

- Review the application configuration: Check the configuration files for your Node.js application. Ensure that all the required settings are correctly specified and that there are no typos or incorrect values.

- Enable debugging mode: Temporarily enable debugging in your application to get more detailed information about the error. You can use the `--inspect` flag when starting your Node.js application to enable the debugging mode.

- Use console.log statements: Place console.log statements strategically in your code to output relevant variables, function calls, or intermediate results. This will help you track the flow of execution and identify any unexpected values or behaviors.

- Use a debugger: You can use a Node.js debugger like the built-in `inspect` module or external tools like Chrome DevTools or Visual Studio Code's debugger. Set breakpoints at critical points in your code to pause execution and inspect the state of variables and objects.

- Search for similar issues: If you're unable to identify the issue after reviewing the code and dependencies, search for the error message or symptoms online. Look for similar issues reported by others and see if there are any recommended solutions or workarounds.

- Fix the identified issue: Once you have identified the root cause of the error, apply the necessary fix to your code. This may involve correcting syntax errors, updating dependencies, modifying configuration settings, or reworking the logic of your application.

- Test and verify the fix: After making the necessary changes, test your application to ensure that the error is resolved. Run the application and verify that it starts successfully without any errors.

- Document the solution: Document the error message, the steps you took to debug and fix the issue, and the resolution. This documentation will be helpful for future reference and for sharing knowledge with others.

*Note*: Test your application thoroughly after making any changes to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
